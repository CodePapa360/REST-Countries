## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I encountered some interesting challenges while learning React, React Router, and Redux Toolkit.

- **Embracing Challenges:** I faced some tricky issues while working on the project, like handling complex state and integrating data. These challenges, while tough, were the moments when I learned the most.

- **Becoming a Detective:** Debugging became my new superpower. I spent a lot of time hunting down bugs and troubleshooting issues. It was frustrating at times, but it made me better at fixing things.

- **The Importance of Planning:** I discovered that having a plan and an organized structure for my project can save a lot of time and reduce stress.
